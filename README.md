![Streamlit](https://img.shields.io/badge/Streamlit-FF4B4B?style=for-the-badge&logo=Streamlit&logoColor=white)

A machine learning system that classifies emails as spam or legitimate (ham) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques.

## Features

- **Accurate Classification**: Achieves over 95% accuracy in spam detection
- **Real-time Processing**: Instantly analyzes email content
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple web app built with Streamlit
- **Explainable AI**: Shows processed text and confidence scores
- **Adaptive Learning**: Handles evolving spam patterns

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python, TensorFlow/Keras
- **NLP**: NLTK, TF-IDF Vectorization
- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Machine Learning**: Dense Neural Network with Dropout

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spam-email-detection.git
   cd spam-email-detection
Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Download NLTK resources:
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download(['stopwords', 'punkt', 'wordnet', 'omw-1.4'])"


Training the Model:
python train_model.py

Running the Web App:
streamlit run app.py
